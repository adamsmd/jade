# Jade: The Java Decompiler

Jade is a Java decompiler that aims for high reliability through extensive testing.

## Requirements

The only requirement is to have a copy of the [Java
JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
installed so that `java` can be run.

Building the tool automatically downloads the other parts that are needed.

## Building

To compile the project for use, simply run the following:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

## Usage

After building simply run:

```shell
TODO
```

## TODO

See src/Module.md for the code structure
